const summaryPrompt = `Generate a ${difficulty}-level summary on ${topic}.
  Focus on core concepts. Use bullet points. Limit to 150 words.`;
Few-Shot Prompting:

javascript
Copy
const quizPrompt = `Generate 5 multiple-choice questions on ${topic} at ${difficulty} level.
  Format each as:
  Question: [question]
  A) [option1]
  B) [option2]
  C) [option3]
  Answer: [correct letter]`;
Parameters Tuned
Temperature:

Summary: 0.3 (low for factual accuracy).

Quiz: 0.7 (higher for creative distractors).

Flashcards: 0.5 (balanced for diverse yet accurate terms).

Max Tokens:
